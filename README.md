# What is Hanoi Towers

Hanoi towers is a problem where you need to move a tower made of disks of decreasing size. You have one extra tower that you can use. The only rule is that you cannot place a disk of a larger size on top of a smaller disk.

Initially this seems pretty easy but you'll see that the LIFO nature of the towers makes it harder to move the largest disks on the bottom.

The solution to this problem is a very easy concept if solved recursively. You can find this function in this project under the name hanoi().
